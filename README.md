Object recognition in images from the CIFAR-10 image dataset

The task involves the design of a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) to recognize objects in images. 
The CIFAR-10 image dataset developed by the Canadian Institute For Advanced Research (CIFAR), containing 60,000 images divided into 10 classes; aeroplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship and truck, is the source data used for this task. The source images are 3-channel images of size 32 Ã— 32. 
This task aims to train a CNN to classify the images from the CIFAR-10 with an accuracy of at least 80. To achieve this, a script based on the pytouch framework in the Touch library was written in Python programming language within a Jupiter notebook. 
The trained CNN was able to classify the images with an accuracy of 80.89%.
